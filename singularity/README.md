# SINGULARITY

 - Step 1: install singularity on your computer following instructions at https://sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/installation.html
   (not sure this can work on windows, the windows instructions on this page make you install a virtual env which is not what we are looking for).
   
 - Step 2: Run `./build`. This will create a container.sif file, which is necessary for running scripts inside `/cluster_scripts` directory
